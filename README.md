# Getting Started
- This repository contains all the files necessary for the execution of Web Development Experiment 4, a Quiz Application using Typescript
- Make sure that you have a version of NodeJS Installed &gt; v20
- I cannot guarantee if the script will work with older versions
- Make sure to have the latest version of `npm` installed as well
- You'll also need an up-to-date browser, preferrably Mozilla Firefox :)

# Running the code
- Make sure that you are in the correct directory. The package.json file should exist in the same directory
- Run `npm install --save-dev`
- Once that's completed, run `npm run dev`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, the quiz application should be up and running

# Features
- This application uses Typescript, TailwindCSS and a bit of NodeJS Utils for the dev setup
